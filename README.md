- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, this is @DrakesProjects, where I display all the CS-related work I've been up to (at least the work I'm inclined to show off).
- I study mathematics and economics at New York University, Class of 2027.
- I'm interested in algorithmic problem solving, data analytics, and the power of automation.
- Send all inquiries to Drake.adams@hotmail.com
